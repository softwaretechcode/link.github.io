    "title": "New Features Of Angular",
    "subTitle": "this is our first post demo",
    "slug": "new-features-of-angular",
    "content": "<h2>1. Angular Signals</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/signals\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Angular Signals</a>&nbsp;is the main feature developers have been waiting for since the Angular 16 roadmap was released. Although Solid.js inspired this concept, it is a whole new concept for Angular. It allows you to define reactive values and express dependencies between them. In other words, you can efficiently use Angular signals to manage state changes within Angular applications.</p>\n\n<p>A signal can be recognized as a regular variable that users can synchronously access. But it comes with some additional features like notifying others (component templates, other signals, functions, etc.) of its value changes and creating a derived state in a declarative way.</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"language-typescript\">import { Component, computed, effect, signal } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\nimport { CommonModule } from &#39;@angular/common&#39;;\nimport { bootstrapApplication } from &#39;@angular/platform-browser&#39;;\n\n@Component({\n  selector: &#39;my-app&#39;,\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [CommonModule],\n  template: `\n    &lt;h1&gt;Calculate Area&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Answer : {{ area() }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button (click)=&quot;calculateArea(10,10)&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;\n  `,\n})\n\nexport class App {\n    height = signal(5);\n    width = signal(5);\n    area = computed(() =&gt; this.height() * this.width());\n    constructor() {\n      effect(() =&gt; console.log(&#39;Value changed:&#39;, this.area()));\n    }\n    calculateArea(height: number, width: number) {\n      this.height.set(height);\n      this.width.set(width);\n    }\n}</code></pre>\n\n<p>In this example, I have created a computed value&nbsp;<strong>area</strong>&nbsp;and two signals named&nbsp;<strong>height</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>width</strong>. When the values of the signals are changed by invoking the&nbsp;<strong>calculateArea()</strong>&nbsp;function, the computed value will be updated and displayed in the template. Here is a working&nbsp;<a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/category/web-development/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">example</a>&nbsp;for you to try it.</p>\n\n<p>Although this looks fantastic, Angular has not abandoned zone.js and RxJS. Signals are an optional feature, and Angular will still work without them. Angular will gradually&nbsp;<a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/category/web-development/angular/\">improve Signals</a>&nbsp;in upcoming versions to make it a complete package.</p>\n\n<h2>2. Server-Side Rendering</h2>\n\n<p>The lack of server-side rendering (SSR) support was one of the most significant drawbacks of Angular compared to React. Angular 16 has resolved this issue with some significant improvements for server-side rendering.</p>\n\n<p>Before, Angular used destructive hydration for SSR. In destructive hydration, the server first renders and loads the application to the browser. Then, when the client app gets downloaded and bootstrapped, it destroys the already rendered DOM and re-renders the client app from scratch. This approach caused significant UX issues, like screen flickering, and negatively impacted some Core Web Vitals such as LCP or CLS.anug.</p>\n\n<p>Angular 16 introduces a new approach called&nbsp;<strong>non-destructive hydration</strong>&nbsp;to prevent these drawbacks. The DOM is not destroyed when the client app is downloaded and bootstrapped. It uses the same DOM while enriching it with client-side features like event listeners.</p>\n\n<p>Non-destructive hydration is still at the developer preview stage. But you can enable it by adding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/provideClientHydration\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">provideClientHydration()</a>&nbsp;as a provider when bootstrapping the application.</p>\n\n<pre>\n<code class=\"language-typescript\">import {\n bootstrapApplication,\n provideClientHydration,\n} from &#39;@angular/platform-browser&#39;;\n\n...\n\nbootstrapApplication(RootCmp, {\n providers: [provideClientHydration()]\n});</code></pre> \n\n<p>According to the official Angular release note, this is just the beginning. They plan to explore partial hydration as the next step and work on several developer requests. You can find more about the Angular SSR development plan</p>\n\n<h2>3.

But how can you pick between angular vs react? Should you base your selection on the project&rsquo;s specifications first? Or, in the early stages, consider its popularity and ramp-up time?</p>\n\n<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between Angular and React? For years, there has been a violent rivalry between these two prominent front-end frameworks. So, which option is the best?</p>\n\n<p>Every time front-end programming is required, the Angular vs React debate occurs. The answer relies on a variety of circumstances, and even front-end developers have debated the topic for years.</p>\n\n<p>Angular is a Google-developed and maintained web framework that was first released in 2010 under the name AngularJS. It quickly became one of the most popular web frameworks at the time. This was owing to capabilities like two-way data binding and dependency injection, as well as the fact that it was supported by a tech giant.</p>\n\n<p>Angular (also known as Angular 2.0) was released in September 2016 as a complete redesign of AngularJS (Angular 1.0), which was first released in 2010.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Read Here :-&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/angular-library-to-convert-number-to-words/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Angular Library to convert number to words | Angular Tutorial</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>React, a JavaScript library used by Facebook, was open-sourced in 2013. This framework popularised a web development concept known as component-based architecture, which has a number of benefits, including:</p>\n\n<p>Components that are modular and coherent, making them highly reusable and contributing to a faster development time.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s used in mobile development since it allows developers to reuse the logical section of an app while simply changing the view.</p>\n\n<p>Easy maintenance and improvement due to self-contained components.</p>\n\n<p>React immediately swept the market, overtaking most of the frameworks available at the time, including AngularJS. As a result of the community&rsquo;s passion for component-based architecture, Google improved their JavaScript framework in 2016 and named it Angular2.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Features of Angular</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Built-in support for AJAX, HTTP, and Observables are just a few of Angular&rsquo;s highlights. There is widespread support in the community.</li>\n\t<li>In line with current technologies</li>\n\t<li>Typescript is time-saving.</li>\n\t<li>Coding that is more clear and concise</li>\n\t<li>Error-handling support has been improved.</li>\n\t<li>Angular CLI allows for seamless updates.</li>\n\t<li>Validation and forms</li>\n\t<li>Local CSS / shadow DOM</li>\n\t<li>Separation of User Interface and Business Logic</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Read More :-&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/10-best-angular-ui-libraries-10-best-angular-ui-components-library/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>10 Best Angular UI Libraries | 10 best angular ui components library</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Key Features of React</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>React&rsquo;s key features include the ability to use third-party libraries.</li>\n\t<li>Time-Saving</li>\n\t<li>Composability and Simplicity</li>\n\t<li>Facebook is fully behind you.</li>\n\t<li>Improved user experience and lightning-fast speed.</li>\n\t<li>More rapid development</li>\n\t<li>One-directional data binding provides code stability.</li>\n\t<li>Components in React</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Key Difference of Angular vs React</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Advantages of Angular</strong></p>\n\n<p>The following are some of the advantages of utilising Angular:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Clean code development is available.</li>\n\t<li>Increased Efficiency</li>\n\t<li>Interface Inspired by Material Design</li>\n\t<li>Because an angular framework can handle routing, switching from one view to another is simple.</li>\n\t<li>Angular CLI for Seamless Updates</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Read More :-&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/10-best-web-development-frameworks-in-2022-frontend-backend/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>10 Best Web Development Frameworks in 2022 (Frontend &amp;

As an Angular developer, I found this upgrade interesting since there were some significant improvements compared to the previous version.</p>\n\n<p>So, in this article, I will discuss the top 7&nbsp;<a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/angular-vs-react-difference-between-angular-and-react/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">features of Angular</a>&nbsp;16 to give you a better understanding.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"1.

Angular Signals</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://angular.io/guide/signals\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Angular Signals</a>&nbsp;is the main feature developers have been waiting for since the Angular 16 roadmap was released. Although Solid.js inspired this concept, it is a whole new concept for Angular. It allows you to define reactive values and express dependencies between them. In other words, you can efficiently use Angular signals to manage state changes within Angular applications.</p>\n\n<p>A signal can be recognized as a regular variable that users can synchronously access. But it comes with some additional features like notifying others (component templates, other signals, functions, etc.) of its value changes and creating a derived state in a declarative way.</p>\n\n<pre>\nimport { Component, computed, effect, signal } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\nimport { CommonModule } from &#39;@angular/common&#39;;\nimport { bootstrapApplication } from &#39;@angular/platform-browser&#39;;</pre>\n\n<pre>\n@Component({\n  selector: &#39;my-app&#39;,\n  standalone: true,\n  imports: [CommonModule],\n  template: `\n    &lt;h1&gt;Calculate Area&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;Answer : {{ area() }}&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button (click)=&quot;calculateArea(10,10)&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/button&gt;\n  `,\n})export class App {\n    height = signal(5);\n    width = signal(5);\n    area = computed(() =&gt; this.height() * this.width());\n    constructor() {\n      effect(() =&gt; console.log(&#39;Value changed:&#39;, this.area()));\n    }\n    calculateArea(height: number, width: number) {\n      this.height.set(height);\n      this.width.set(width);\n    }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>In this example, I have created a computed value area and two signals named height and width. When the values of the signals are changed by invoking the calculateArea() function, the computed value will be updated and displayed in the template. Here is a working&nbsp;<a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/category/web-development/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">example</a>&nbsp;for you to try it.</p>\n\n<p>Although this looks fantastic, Angular has not abandoned zone.js and RxJS. Signals are an optional feature, and Angular will still work without them. Angular will gradually&nbsp;<a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/category/web-development/angular/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">improve Signals</a>&nbsp;in upcoming versions to make it a complete package.</p>\n\n<h1>2. Server-Side Rendering</h1>\n\n<p>The lack of server-side rendering (SSR) support was one of the most significant drawbacks of Angular compared to React. Angular 16 has resolved this issue with some significant improvements for server-side rendering.</p>\n\n<p>Before, Angular used destructive hydration for SSR. In destructive hydration, the server first renders and loads the application to the browser. Then, when the client app gets downloaded and bootstrapped, it destroys the already rendered DOM and re-renders the client app from scratch. This approach caused significant UX issues, like screen flickering, and negatively impacted some Core Web Vitals such as LCP or CLS.anug.</p>\n\n<p>Angular 16 introduces a new approach called non-destructive hydration to prevent these drawbacks. The DOM is not destroyed when the client app is downloaded and bootstrapped. It uses the same DOM while enriching it with client-side features like event listeners.</p>\n\n<p>Non-destructive hydration is still at the developer preview stage. But you can enable it by adding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://angular.io/api/platform-browser/provideClientHydration\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">provideClientHydration()</a>&nbsp;as a provider when bootstrapping the application.</p>\n\n<pre>\nimport {\n bootstrapApplication,\n provideClientHydration,\n} from &#39;@angular/platform-browser&#39;;</pre>\n\n<pre>\n...bootstrapApplication(RootCmp, {\n providers: [provideClientHydration()]\n});</pre>\n\n<p>According to the official Angular release note, this is just the beginning. They plan to explore partial hydration as the next step and work on several developer requests. You can find more about the Angular SSR development plan</p>\n\n<h1>3. Experimental Jest Support</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Jest</a>&nbsp;is one of the most-used testing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/10-best-web-development-frameworks-in-2022-frontend-backend/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">frameworks</a>&nbsp;among JavaScript developers. Angular has listened to developer requests and has introduced experimental Jest support with Angular 16.</p>\n\n<p>All you have to do is install Jest using npm and update the angular.json file.</p>\n\n<pre>\n// Install jest\nnpm install jest --save-dev</pre>\n\n<pre>\n// angular.json\n{\n  &quot;projects&quot;: {\n    &quot;my-app&quot;: {\n      &quot;architect&quot;: {\n        &quot;test&quot;: {\n          &quot;builder&quot;: &quot;@angular-devkit/build-angular:jest&quot;,\n          &quot;options&quot;: {\n            &quot;tsConfig&quot;: &quot;tsconfig.spec.json&quot;,\n            &quot;polyfills&quot;: [&quot;zone.js&quot;, &quot;zone.js/testing&quot;]\n          }\n        }\n      }\n   }\n}</pre>\n\n<p>They plan to move all the existing Karma projects to Web Test Runner in future updates.</p>\n\n<h1>4. esbuild-Based Build System</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Read More :-</em><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/angular-16-is-launch-discover-the-top-7-features-angular-developer/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"><em>https://softwaretechit.com/angular-16-is-launch-discover-the-top-7-features-angular-developer/</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h1>Related Blogs:-</h1>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/create-a-angular-reactive-login-form-login-form-using-bootstrap-and-angular/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Create A Angular Reactive Login Form | Login Form Using Bootstrap And Angular</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/create-a-angular-reactive-login-form-login-form-using-bootstrap-and-angular/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Create A Angular Reactive Login Form | Login Form Using Bootstrap And Angular</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/angular-part-6-1-add-product-in-cart-and-update-table-using-flask-api-create-ecommerce-angular/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Angular Part 6&ndash;1: Add Product In Cart And Update Table Using Flask API | Create Ecommerce Angular</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/angular-create-product-list-and-api-call-create-ecommerce-angular-project-with-api-call/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Angular : Create Product List And API Call | Create ECommerce Angular Project With API Call</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/call-web-api-from-angular-8-example-api-in-angular-create-website/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Call Web API from angular 8 Example |API In Angular Create Website</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/angular-vs-react-difference-between-angular-and-react/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Angular Vs React: Difference Between Angular and React</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/10-best-angular-ui-libraries-10-best-angular-ui-components-library/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">10 Best Angular UI Libraries | 10 best angular ui components library</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Read Original Article :-&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://softwaretechit.com/angular-16-is-launch-discover-the-top-7-features-angular-developer/\" rel=\"noopener ugc nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://softwaretechit.com/angular-16-is-launch-discover-the-top-7-features-angular-developer/</a></p>\n",
